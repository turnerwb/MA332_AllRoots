# MA332_AllRoots

## MA332 Intro to Computational Science: Project 1

The goal of this project is to program a MATLAB funciton `AllRoots()` that attempts to find all the roots, real or complex, of a polynomial.
- The algorithm we are using is based on Newton's Method which can be found in the `NewtonPoly()` sub-function
- This project is based of off Exercise 1.14 from [__An Introduction to Computational Science__](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/an-introduction-to-computational-science-allen-holder/1133089216)
